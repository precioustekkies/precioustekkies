Title: Differential effect of supercoiling on bacterial transcription in topological domains.
Abstract: DNA supercoiling (SC), the over- and under-winding of DNA, is generated by transcription as described in the twin-domain model. Conversely, SC also impacts transcription through torsional stress. SC therefore regulates transcription dynamically and independently of transcription factor binding, particularly in the context of chromosomal topological domains and the activity of topoisomerases in bacteria. In this work, we develop numerical simulations of SC-coupled transcription of a single gene within a topological domain, based on a model incorporating stochastic transcription and activities of topoisomerase I and gyrase. We explore the effect of several parameters not systematically assessed in previous works (role of topoisomerase activities, topological domain size, gene expression strength) and compare the simulation results to a diverse set of experimental observations ranging from in vitro transcription assays to transcriptomics datasets from various species. This model recapitulates the non-monotonic dependence of transcription in vitro with the superhelical density of the plasmid template. Simulations of in vivo transcription in a closed domain exhibit a qualitatively different role for the two topoisomerases, as well as qualitatively different regulatory behaviors depending on the promoter strength. Specifically, topoisomerase I is required for strongly expressed genes that may be hindered by stalled RNA Polymerase, whereas gyrase activity favors the expression of all genes by enhancing transcription initiation and modulating the burstiness of transcription. The simulations exhibit a new mechanism for transcription bursting mediated by negative SC accumulating at the promoter region and modulating the initiation rate, resulting in levels of burstiness compatible with values reported in cells. Finally, we analyze several transcriptomics datasets from a range of evolutionarily distant species and show that topoisomerase inhibition is systematically associated with the repression of highly expressed genes. Simulations show this behavior to occur within a limited parameter range and thus indicate a biologically relevant regime for the simulations. Overall, this work provides a more quantitative description of how SC contributes to differential gene regulation and transcriptional bursting in bacteria.

Title: Sequence and supercoiling-dependent effects on the structural dynamics of DNA minicircles.
Abstract: The degree of over-... of the DNA double helix, quantified by the superhelical density, is a key feature modulating critical biological processes such as gene expression and regulation. In fact, DNA molecules are able to channel the excess levels of mechanical stress into local defective and denatured states that are promptly detected by, e.g., transcription factors and nuclease enzymes. The occurrence and stability of these motifs are dictated by a complex interplay between topological and sequence-dependent effects, ultimately affecting the global conformational dynamics of the DNA molecule itself. Here, we characterize the impact of the sequence and of the superhelical density on the structural evolution of a 672-bp DNA minicircle via classical molecular dynamics simulations employing the coarse-grained oxDNA force field. We observe that moderately-to-highly undercoiled regimes are associated with the occurrence of stable, somewhat broad denaturation bubbles, typically co-localizing with flexible nucleotide sequences on the DNA minicircle. These defects are hardly reabsorbed by the system, thereby pinning the subsequent dynamics of the molecule. In fact, a similar behavior was recapitulated by enforcing "synthetic,"adjoining DNA mismatches, regardless of the underlying nucleotide sequence, suggesting an effective manner of DNA manipulation.

Title: Emergence of supercoiling-mediated regulatory networks through the evolution of bacterial chromosome organization.
Abstract: DNA supercoiling-the level of twisting and writhing of the DNA molecule around itself-plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression in bacteria by modulating promoter activity. The level of DNA supercoiling is a dynamic property of the chromosome which varies both at local and global scales, in response to both external factors such as environmental perturbations and internal factors including gene transcription. As such, local variations in supercoiling could in theory couple the expression levels of neighboring genes by creating feedback loops at the transcriptional level. However, the impact of such supercoiling-mediated interactions on the regulation of gene expression still remains uncertain. In this work, we study how this coupling between transcription and supercoiling could shape genome organization and help regulate gene transcription. We present a model of genome evolution in which individuals whose gene transcription rates are coupled to local supercoiling must adapt to two environments that induce different global supercoiling levels. In this model, we observe the evolution of whole-genome regulatory networks that provide control over gene expression by leveraging the transcription-supercoiling coupling, and show that the structure of these networks is underpinned by the organization of genes along the chromosome at several scales. Local variations in DNA supercoiling could therefore help jointly shape both gene regulation and genome organization during evolution.

Title: Smilax glabra Roxb. extract alleviates psoriasis-like lesions in mice by the synergistic effects of TOP2A inhibition and AhR activation.
Abstract: Psoriasis is an incurable and recurrent skin disease, and the need to develop new strategies for the treatment of psoriasis persists. Smilax glabra Roxb. (SGR) is listed as a key traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of psoriasis through medicinal bath therapy in "Guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis in China"; the active ingredients responsible for its anti-psoriatic effects and their mechanisms of action still require in-depth research. In this study, we first found that the topical application of SGR extract showed an anti-psoriasis effect in mice by using IMQ-induced primary and recurrent psoriasis mouse model. Network pharmacology, molecular docking, supercoiled DNA relaxation assay, luciferase reporter gene assay, and animal pharmacodynamics revealed that astilbin, quercetin, and resveratrol were key anti-psoriatic compounds in SGR extract for treating psoriasis by inhibiting TOP2A and activating AhR. These findings suggested that the synergistic effect of TOP2A inhibition and AhR activation was the key mechanism of SGR for the treatment of psoriasis. The combination of AhR activation and TOP2A inhibition synergistically alleviated psoriasis-like lesions and ameliorated the relapse of psoriasis-like lesions in mice. AhR activation and TOP2A inhibition synergistically regulated the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway and keratinization progress to prevent the relapse of psoriasis. This study investigates the "multi-component, multi-target" mechanism of SGR in treating psoriasis from the perspective of the interaction between targets, providing a new strategy for psoriasis topical treatment: the combination of TOP2A inhibitors and AhR activators.
