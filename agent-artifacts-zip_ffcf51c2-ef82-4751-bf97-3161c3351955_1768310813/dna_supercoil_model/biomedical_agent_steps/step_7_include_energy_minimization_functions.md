Step 7: Include energy minimization functions
Energy minimization section created with:
- Total free energy components (twist, bend, electrostatic, entropy)
- Twisting energy equations with torsional rigidity
- Bending energy for plectonemic superhelices
- Energy minimization framework
- Optimal partitioning between twist and writhe
- Energy landscape and structural transitions
- Equilibrium conditions
