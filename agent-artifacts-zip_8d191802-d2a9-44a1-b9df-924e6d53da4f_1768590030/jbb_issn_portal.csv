Scientific Research Highlights

[![learn more](https://www.annexpublishers.co/JSAP1/oamsecure/rh_images/289rh_image.jpg)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24391660)

#### [Identification and interrogation of combinatorial histone modifications](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24391660)

Histone proteins are dynamically modified to mediate a variety of cellular processes including gene transcription, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis. Regulation of these processes occurs through the recruitment of non-histone proteins to chromatin by specific combinations of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs).

[![learn more](https://www.annexpublishers.co/JSAP1/oamsecure/rh_images/288rh_image.jpg)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24392198)

#### [Closed loop adaptive optics for microscopy without a wavefront sensor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24392198)

A three-dimensional wide-field image of a small fluorescent bead contains more than enough information to accurately calculate the wavefront in the microscope objective back pupil plane using the phase retrieval technique.

#### [Quantitative single-cell RNA-seq with unique molecular identifiers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24363023)

Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful tool to reveal cellular heterogeneity, discover new cell types and characterize tumor microevolution. However, losses in cDNA synthesis and bias in cDNA amplification lead to severe quantitative errors.

#### [The Nonenzymatic Decomposition of Guanidines and Amidines](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24359273)

To establish the rates and mechanisms of decomposition of guanidine and amidine derivatives in aqueous solution and the rate enhancements produced by the corresponding enzymes, we examined their rates of reaction at elevated temperatures and used the Arrhenius equation to extrapolate the results to room temperature.

#### [Genomic mining of prokaryotic repressors for orthogonal logic gates](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24316737)

Genetic circuits perform computational operations based on interactions between freely diffusing molecules within a cell. When transcription factors are combined to build a circuit, unintended interactions can disrupt its function. Here, we apply \\'part mining\\' to build a library of 73 TetR-family repressors gleaned from prokaryotic genomes.
