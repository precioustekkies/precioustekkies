## Abstract

**Background:** This study aims to investigate the phytochemical composition, antioxidant and anticancer activity of _Boerhavia diffusa_ extract in rats with hepatocellular carcinoma.

**Methods:** To identify the essential bioactive components _Boerhavia diffusa_ leaves were extracted using ethanol and subjected to GC-MS analysis. In male Sprague Dawley rats, hepatocellular cancer was induced with diethylnitrosamine and then with phenobarbitone. _Boerhavia diffusa_ extract was administered to the induced rats with low dose (250 mg/kg) and high dose (500 mg/kg). Superoxide dismutase and catalase was measured to evaluate the antioxidant activity. Anticancer efficacy was measured by the changes in alpha-fetoprotein, white blood cells, haemoglobin, red blood cells and histopathological analysis of liver. GC-MS analysis confirmed the ethanolic extract of Boerhavia diffusa contained phytoconstituents like vitamin E, phytol and β-sitosterol.

**Results:** Hemoglobin, WBC and RBC were significantly decreased in DEN induced group and recovered in extract administered group. The treated groups showed significantly higher levels of antioxidant enzyme activity, particularly CAT (1.49±0.092) and SOD (0.15±0.001), suggesting increased oxidative defense. Higher alpha-fetoprotein levels (6.97±0.623 ng/ml) were found in the carcinoma induced group and considerably lower level (4.43±0.521 ng/ml) was observed following the extract administration. Microscopic examination of the liver revealed restoration of hepatocytes in treated rats with less inflammation and reduced necrosis.

**Conclusion:** This research suggests that the ethanolic extract of _Boerhavia diffusa_ reveals notable antioxidant and anticancer properties, indicating its potential as a treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. _Boerhavia diffusa_ was used in traditional medicine for liver diseases, have scientific evidence by the presence of bioactive phytochemicals.

**7\. Editorial Policies**

The editorial policies describe guidelines in the publication process of this journal. Submission to this journal implies that all authors have thoroughly reviewed and consented to its content, and that their manuscript complies with the journal's editorial policies. We is closely monitoring ongoing developments in this field and will update its policies as needed.

**7.1 Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

This journal does not accept any submissions generated with AI or AI-assisted technologies, nor can AI or AI-assisted technologies be credited or cited as an author. Images generated or modified by AI tools or large-scale generative models are not permitted. Authors who use AI-assisted technologies in their research studies are required to disclose and provide details on how AI was used for tasks as well as the name and version of the AI tool used. Editors may decline to move forward with manuscripts if AI is used inappropriately. Authors are fully responsible for the content of their paper, even the parts produced by AI tools. To maintain the confidentiality of the manuscripts, reviewers should not use AI technologies when generating or writing reviews.

**7.2 Authorship and Contributorship**

**A: Authorship**

Authorship of a manuscript should be limited to authors who have made significant contributions.

ICMJE recommends that authorship be based on the following four criteria.

1\. Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work;

2\. Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content;

3\. Final approval of the version to be published;

4\. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.

**B: Changes in Authorship**

Authors should decide upon the correct name and order of authors before submitting their manuscripts to the journal. Any addition, deletion or rearrangement of author names in the authorship list should be made only before the manuscript has been accepted and only approved by the journal editor. Following the COPE guidelines, the corresponding author should explain the reason for changing authorship to journal editor first. Then, request to change authorship will be carefully reviewed by the journal editor and Editorial Board members. The authorship can only be changed with the Publisher's consent

**C: Contributorship**

This journal adheres to COPE and ICMJE Recommendations regarding authorship and contributorship. To ensuring transparency, a contributorship statement may be requested, specifying each author's specific contributions. For the contributors who indirectly involved with the research (e.g., technical support; loans of experimental facilities; comments or suggestions during the creation of the manuscript), we encourage authors to list them in an Acknowledgments section in their publication with permission.

**7.3 Conflict of Interest**

All participants in the peer review and publication process—authors, reviewers, editorial board members and editors of journals—must consider their conflicts of interest when fulfilling their roles in the peer review and publication process and must disclose all potential conflicts of interest.

For the authors, when submitting their manuscripts to the journal, full disclosure of the conflict of interest is required.

For the reviewers/editorial board members, they should decline to review a manuscript if they have a potential conflict of interest.

For the editors, they must have no personal, professional, or financial relationship with any of the authors.

**7.4 Concurrent Submissions**

Authors are limited to having two manuscripts under review at any point in time, so that sufficient diversity within the authorship of the journal can be ensured. If an author already has two manuscripts under review in the journal, they will need to wait until the review process of at least one of these manuscripts is complete before submitting another manuscript for consideration.

**7.5 Duplicate Submission**

Duplicate submission refers to authors' practice of submitting the same or similar manuscripts to more than one journal for consideration, which is regarded as misconduct. These submissions can be nearly simultaneous or years later and there are no substantial differences between them.

**7.6 Redundant Publication**

Redundant publication is generally considered unethical and usually occurs when multiple papers share the same text, data or results which refers to the situation that a paper is split into several parts and submitted to two or more journals; or are written without proper cross-referencing, permission or justification.

**7.7 Manuscript Transfer Service**

When submitting your manuscript for publication, your initial choice of journal may not always be the perfect fit. In that case, our journal editors will use their expertise to analyze manuscripts and identify alternative journals they think would be more suitable. If a manuscript needs to be transferred to another journal, authors will receive an email with the details of the recommended journal from our journal's Editorial Team. The decision on accepting or declining the transfer recommendation is up to the authors and we will not transfer the manuscript to another journal without the authors' explicit permission and approval. However, if we do not receive any reply from the authors regarding the transfer 4 weeks after the initial transfer recommendation email, the manuscripts will be rejected automatically.

**7.8 Citation Manipulation**

Authors should only cite relevant sources in their manuscripts and any unethical citation practices should be avoid.

**7.9 License and Permission**

Under the premise of legal publishing, the corresponding author is required to grant an exclusive license to Horizon Research Publishing on behalf of all authors.

Once the submitted paper is accepted for publication, authors will be invited to fill in an electronic copyright transfer form. If the form hasn’t been received along with the final revised manuscript, the publication of your manuscript may be postponed.

Manuscripts submitted for publication must be original, previously unpublished, and not under consideration for publication elsewhere. If previously published materials written by others have to be used, the copyright-owner’s permission must be obtained prior to submission. The author takes the responsibility for checking whether material submitted is subject to copyright or ownership rights. To avoid delay in publication, it would be better for authors to start obtaining all the permissions as early as possible. If in any doubt about the copyright , apply for permission. HRPUB cannot publish material from other publications without permission. If any unpermitted material used in the article is found, the article will be rejected or removed from our website, even if it has already been published.

**7.10 Plagiarism Policy**

Plagiarism, an action of taking other people's language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions as one's own original work is considered academic dishonesty and a violation of journalistic ethics. Reusing portions of one's own published or copyrighted work in their new publications is self-plagiarism. A breach of copyright law or punishment by legal action may be involved in plagiarism. All manuscripts submitted to our journals will be screened by a plagiarism detection software. Plagiarism tools, such as CrossCheck/iThenticate, Turnitin etc. can be used for plagiarism detection.

To avoid plagiarism, authors confirm that:

1\. I/We understand plagiarism is against the professional ethics;

2\. Quoted verbatim texts are marked clearly with quotation marks;

3\. Quotation sources are referenced clearly both in the text and in the Reference section;

4\. Citing the source of equations, figures or tables properly with the permission from the original author or copyright holder;

5\. Avoid self-plagiarism; do not copy portions of one's own published or copyrighted work without proper citation;

6\. No copyrighted materials are used in the manuscript without permission;

7\. The manuscript is free from plagiarism and has not been published previously;

8\. I/We will take full responsibility for the opinion expressed in the paper and settling in all disputes arising from using any copyrighted materials in the manuscript without proper permission.

The author will be required to clarify regarding the plagiarized manuscript within one week if it is found to be suspected of plagiarism during any stages even after publication. Without a reasonable and timely explanation, the manuscript will be automatically rejected or removed from the system and any manuscripts submitted by the same author will not be accepted.

**7.11 Manuscript Review**

**A: Initial Screening (7 working days)**

Submitted manuscripts will be initially screened by the editorial assistant for completeness and to determine if the manuscript meets the general criteria for the journal from the following aspects:

(1). The manuscripts should be within the scope of a specific journal.

(2). The manuscripts should be of acceptable quality.

(3). The manuscripts should compliant with the journal's instruction for authors.

(4). The title should be as brief as possible with no more than 20 words.

(5). All authors of a manuscript should include their full names. Provide the full affiliation for each author including Department, Faculty, University, City, Zip Code, State.

(6). A good abstract (200-350 words) should provide the essence of the manuscript in a concise paragraph.

(7). 3-10 keywords should be included for indexing.

(8). A manuscript should be well organized into logical sections. The preferred order of contents should be as follows: Introduction, Methodology, Results, Discussion and Conclusion. Acknowledgements, Appendix, References.

(9). All references should be numbered sequentially in the text and listed in the same numerical order in the reference section. The section of references should be more than eight.

(10). All references should be cited in the right citation style.


(11). Figures and tables used in the manuscripts should be relevant to the Task, with informative content and high resolution.

(12). Each figure should be numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals and accompanied by an appropriate descriptive caption.

(13). Each table should be numbered consecutively and labeled with an explanatory title.

(14). Equations should be generated using the equation editor embedded in MS Word or Math Type.

(15). Submissions vary from 5 to 20 pages in two-column format (at least 3000 words but no more than 10000 words, inclusive of references).

(16). The Manuscripts must be written in English. The clarity and fluency of the language should be ensured.

The editorial office will decide to: (a) send the manuscript out for double blind review, (b) request initial revisions prior to the double blind review process, or (c) reject the manuscript. The initial screening result will be sent to the corresponding author via email within 7 working days.

**B: Peer Review (3-4 Weeks)**

The journal employs a double-blind peer review system, which is the most important aspect of the publication process of an article. Each manuscript passing initial screening will be subjected to rigorous and anonymous peer-review by a minimum of 2 peer reviewers. Referees who review a manuscript remain unknown to the authors. The journal’s independent status ensures a submission acceptance rate based on merit and not favor, bias, or personal preference. The reviewers make a recommendation to accept, revise, or reject a manuscript based on the scientific merit, technical quality, and adherence to ethical standards of the studies reported. All the reviewers send the editorial assistant a detailed report with their comments and recommendations on the manuscript. Authors receive reviewers’ comments and recommendations from the editorial assistant and they never enter in contact with reviewers. Usually, reviewers will complete their reviews within 3-4 weeks.

**C: Revision after Peer Review (15 working days)**

Authors are required to revise the manuscripts according to the comments of the reviewers and answer all questions raised by reviewers in a cover letter. Any revisions should be marked out. The revised manuscripts and cover letters are required to be sent to us via email in MS Word or LaTex format within 15 working days. If you are submitting in LaTeX, please convert the files to PDF beforehand (you will also need to send your LaTeX source files together with the PDF). Upon resubmission, the academic editor may choose to return the manuscript to the reviewers for additional review, or may render a decision of accepting, recommending modification or rejecting based on his/her personal expertise.

**7.12 Proof Reading (Within 3 working days)**

Proofreading is the final stage of the editing process. We will conduct efficient and thorough proofreading process for all the accepted manuscripts. The proofs will be sent to the authors for final confirmation; authors get the chance of checking before publication and are responsible for verifying the accuracy and completeness of all content. Proofs should be checked and returned within 3 days, or they will be regarded as the final version. However, significant changes to proofs may lead to additional editorial review.

**7.13 Acceptance Letters (Within 7 working days)**

After the revision process, qualified manuscripts will be accepted for publication. The Acceptance Letters will be sent to the corresponding authors within 7 working days.

**7.14 Article Charge Processing**

In an open access model, we promise that readers don’t pay for the subscription fee to access online published articles. For authors, only some fundamental costs like editing, production and peer- review are included to maintain normal operations of our company. These Article Processing Charges(APC) are only used to support publishers to make the published articles freely available to all readers. The payment option in our Online Manuscript Tracking System is disabled by default for each manuscript and it is only enabled when the manuscript has been accepted for publication. In that case, authors do not need to make payment until their manuscripts have been reviewed and accepted for publication. The charge is a flat and single charge without additional costs.

**7.15 Publication Notification (A Week after Publication)**

After the article is released on the journal’s website, a publication notification will be sent to the corresponding author with links to the article.

**7.16 Archiving Policies**

All the publications are preserved in our own database and available online. Besides, authors may self-archive the final published versions of their articles/ any version of their articles on their institutional repositories or other appropriate repositories or websites.

**7.17 Article Withdrawal, Retraction and Correction**

**A: Article Withdrawal**

Manuscripts that have not yet officially published can be withdrawn upon a formal written request stating the reason for the withdrawal. The manuscripts passed the withdrawal request will no longer be archived in our system.

**B: Article Retraction**

An article may be retracted if misconduct has been found (e.g. plagiarism, redundant publishing, falsifying data, or when there are serious or major errors invalidating the article’s results and conclusions in the original published article etc.). The publisher and the Editors will follow COPE best practice and flowcharts to launch an investigation to determine whether an article should be retracted. Prior to publishing a retraction, a retraction statement signed by all authors will be required, in which the reason for the retraction and who is retracting the article are clearly indicated. The article will be marked as retracted with limited content accessible online, including article title, authors information, abstract and keywords.

**C: Article Correction**

We encourage authors to report errors in their articles. The correction procedure depends on the publication stage of the article. For accepted manuscripts, no marked or significant changes are permitted to be made. Any significant changes should be made at the revision stage, prior to acceptance. For published articles, corrections are made at the journal's discretion. To maintain the integrity of the scientific record, only errors that significantly impact the article will be considered (where the overall results and conclusions of the article are upheld and there are no concerns about the reliability or integrity of the work), while minor spelling or grammatical errors will be rejected to prevent discrepancies downstream.

**7.18 Confidentiality**

Editors, authors, and reviewers are required to keep confidential all details of the editorial and peer review process on submitted manuscripts. If a reviewer needs to seek advice from colleagues during the review process, the reviewer must consult with the managing editor and must ensure that confidentiality is maintained and that the names of any such colleagues are provided to the journal with the final peer review report. Regardless of whether a submission is finally published, correspondence with the journal, reviewers' reports and other confidential material must not be published, disclosed or publicised without prior written consent.

Arabic numerals are used to designate figures and upper case letters for their parts (i.e., Figure 1). Begin each legend with a title and include sufficient description so that the figure is understandable without reading the text of the manuscript. Information given in legends should not be repeated in the text.

Figure legends should be typed in numerical order on a separate sheet.

**Tables and Equations as Graphics:**

Equations should be submitted in EPS or TIFF format as discrete files (i.e., a file containing only the data for one equation) cannot be submitted in MathML. Only when tables cannot be encoded as XML/SGML they can be submitted as graphics. It is critical that the font size in all equations and tables are consistent and legible throughout all submissions (If this method is used).

**Supplementary information:**

INTRODUCTION

I

n every living being cell-to-cell communication

is very important for healthy survival. The

communication process among cells is called

transduction. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter

that helps in transduction and chemically is a

monoamine catecholamine and ahormone that

carriesoutmanyfunctions.Itisde�nitelymade

in our brain. Being a neurotransmitter the role of

dopamine in our brain is to help us in movement,

memory, mood control, sleep, attention, motivation,

pleasure reward, arousal, behaviour and cognition.

High or low secretion level leads to many

neuromotor diseases in humans. Some of the

common such diseases are hyperactivity disorder,

restless leg and Parkinson’s disease.

Most of the addictive chemical leads to secretion

of high dose of dopamine hormone inour body

and brain. Thishigh dose gives us great sense of

satisfaction and pleasure. On the contrary low

secretion of dopamine in the body leads to mood

swings, unhappy state, being unmotivated and

tired. So optimum amount or a balance amount

of dopamine secretion is required in the body to

remain focused, alert, motivated and happy.

High level of dopamine also leads toproblems

like addiction, mania and obesity. Imbalance level

of dopamine secretion in the brain leads to mental

disorders like Schizophrenia. This is because of

high secretion of dopamine in certain regions of the

brain and low secretion in certain other.

Sometimes this question is generally asked how

do dopamine impacts a drug addicts?

Addictive drug or recreational drugs interfere

with the nervous system of our body. If taken

continuously addictive drugs weakens the nervous

system impacting the response one gets with

reward signal usually when with some dopamine

stimulus. To achieve the same the addicts

continuously depend on the dose of drug they are

edited to a regular interval to get that kick.

Therefore, dopamine is not directly involved

in drug users surge in behaviour. But dopamine

secretionis such designed after addiction that

it gives the urge of going back to the drug intact

aftera�xedtimeandtogetthedesiredrewardof

pleasure.

There certain food that contains high magnesium

dose and it is said magnesium is important for

appropriate dopamine secretion in the body. So, we

need to take good food and nutrients to avoid lack

of dopamine secretion in the body. Good intake of

almond, green leafy vegetables, banana, beetroots,

oranges and green tea are good for dopamine level

in the body.

OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY

Objective of the study is to know the structure

of dopamine and various physiological and

psychiatric disorder associated with dopamine

malfunctioning.

LITERATURE REVIEW

Dopaminergic system is important for mental

health of the human body. Many pathological

conditionslike Schizophenia, Parkinson disease etc

take place because of the disfunctional dopamergic

transmission in the body. Dopamine receptors help

to overcome hallucination and delusion caused

during schizophrenia. Dopamine deregulation in

the body causes serious help issues in the human

body and brain. One of the challenges of scientists,

pharma,medicalexpertsanddoctorshaveto�nd

dopamergic drug which has no adverse effect. A

greatachievementinthe�eldofdopamineresearch

surfaces a decade ago.

\[5\]

The neurotransmitter is involved in behaviours

like food craving, decision making and various

executive functions of human beings. Some human

beings show the symptom of binge eating, which

is also connected with the dopamine regulation

deviation in the body.

\[6\]

We very well know that the neurotransmitters

are very well with the help of neural transmitters

or neural signals from the central and peripheral

nervous system. Dopamine is an important

neurotransmitter of central nervous system that

function in the most of the activities of human

behaviour.

\[7, 8\]

Dopamine is synthesized by the precursors

of kidney and the brain area of an animal body

speci�callyinhumans.Theimportanceof

dopamine in human brain lies in its role in the

sense of pleasure with the work a human beings

do in its day-to-day life. Motor control in humans

and lactation in feeding females are all the result of

proper functioning of dopamine neurotransmitter.

and it is a chemical of catechol family andcalled

catecholamine (Figure 1.1& 1.2).Catechol is the

family in which position 4 hydrogen is substituted

with 2-aminoethyl group.

Only dopamine is not the hormone belong to

the catechol family but adrenaline (epinephrine)

and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) also belong to

this family. These are the hormone secreted from

adrenal gland (Fig. 1.3).

chemical relationships

Figure 1.4represent the biosynthetic pathways

and chemical relationships between all the

neurotransmitter hormones and enzymes involved

in these pathways. Octopamine, norepinephrine,

dopamine, and tyramine are all synthesized by

tyrosine.

Most of the moving animals are found

to have behavioural pattern impacted via

neurotransmitters. In mammals body motions are

dependent on dopamine. Most of their locomotory

action depends on dopamine. In search of food

reward animals move from one place to other as

much as they can. Some of the experiments have

shownthatmammalshavereectstrongresponse

to dopamine both for primary rewards like food

and water and temporary rewards like motivation

etc.

In diseases like Parkinson’s disease (PD) is loss

of nigral dopaminergic neurons.

Fig. 1.5: A sketch diagram of dopamine in

Parkinson’s disease.

Anomalous motor behaviour has been shown to

robustly correlate with measures of communicative

function, suggesting aninvolvement of the

sensorimotor system in impaired communication.

At the neural level this is supported by the evidence

that communicative and motor behaviours have

all been linked to different areas within the basal

ganglia via a series of parallel (yet overlapping)

projections from and to frontal cortical regions.

\[4\]

DISCUSSION

A diseased condition called binge eating disorder

(BED) and bulimia nervosa (BN) is characterised by

eating in huge amount uncontrollably. Enhanced

food craving and decreased decision-making

capacity are some of the effects of this diseased

caused to the human body.

\[7\]

Hedonic hunger is associated with the sense of

lack of energy and people start eating uncontrollably

to attain a desired level of pleasure of eating. Such

situation leads to other health hazards condition

like overweight, obesity and life style diseases

associated with weight gain.

In human body termination of dopamine

function occurs because of clearance of dopamine

singling in the body. This can be impacted by many

chemicals, physical and physicalistic conditions.

The detection of dopamine in real behaviour

in human is very important area of research.

Electronic or electromagnetic biosensors are used to

detect function of dopamine, dopamine regulation

onhumanbehaviour.Nanomaterialmodi�ed

materials electronic devices are used to detect

dopamine regulation and receptions in human

and animal bodies to study its effect on behaviour,

physiology and psychological studies. The

nanomaterials are metals, metal oxides, electrodes,

cathodes, anodes, polymers, carbon oxides etc.

Electromagnetic material or inother words

electronic devices made of nanomaterials help in

easy detection of function of neurotransmitters like

dopamine in the human or animal bodies.

\[8\]

Generally, dopamine is stored in the adrenal

gland and dopaminergic vesicles. Dopamine is

also an important neurotransmitter not only for

brain but also for eye and retina. According to

IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied

Chemistry that names the chemicalmolecules), the

name (ID) of dopamine is as follows: IUPAC ID:

4-(2-aminoethyl) benzene-1,2-diol

\[9\]

CONCLUSION

The study has helped us conclude that

the development of new DNA recombinant

technology has helped us easily identify DNA

receptors subtypes. The technology of use of

targeted mutagenic agent helps us identify

ligand of receptor dopamine. Presently with all

available DNA technologies we are able to identify

dopamine receptors area and its function in the

brain areas. Thestructural details and receptor

areas of dopamine has been explained in this study.

Even the potential function of each receptor sites of

dopamine has also been discussed at large in this

study article. Even the disease cause both with the

hypo and hyper secretion and receptor malfunction

has been mentioned in this study. Behavioural

studies show that human behaviour is very well

dependant on dopamine secretion.

Through our study we have also found out

that dopamine has been also involved in the

food behaviour of human beings. Binge eating is

a symptom of a nervous disease called bulimia

nervosa which is generally connected with other

serious health issues. In these patients, suffer from

strong desire of food at certain trigger situation

whenthey�ndthemselveslackingdopamine

spike in the body and the body crave for the same.

However,theexactphysiologicalmarkertode�ne

binge eating is still lacking among the scientists.

Almost all studies in our review of studies have

indicated the role of dopamine level, regulation

of dopamine and its receptor in the behaviour of

human being related to psychiatric condition and

behaviour work.

Conclusivelywecande�nitelysaythat dopamine

is an amino acid that brings happiness.

Objective
Binge eating, a core diagnostic symptom in binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa, increases the risk of multiple physiological and psychiatric disorders. The neurotransmitter dopamine is involved in food craving, decision making, executive functioning, and impulsivity personality trait; all of which contribute to the development and maintenance of binge eating. The objective of this paper is to review the associations of dopamine levels/activities, dopamine regulator (e.g., dopamine transporter, degrading enzymes) levels/activities, and dopamine receptor availability/affinity with binge eating.

Methods
A literature search was conducted in PubMed and PsycINFO to obtain human and animal studies published since 2010.

Results
A total of 31 studies (25 human, six animal) were included. Among the human studies, there were 12 case–control studies, eight randomized controlled trials, and five cross-sectional studies. Studies used neuroimaging (e.g., positron emission tomography), genetic, and pharmacological (e.g., dopamine transporter inhibitor) techniques to describe or compare dopamine levels/activities, dopamine transporter levels/activities, dopamine degrading enzyme (e.g., catechol-O-methyltransferase) levels/activities, and dopamine receptor (e.g., D1, D2) availability/affinity among participants with and without binge eating. Most human and animal studies supported an altered dopaminergic state in binge eating (26/31, 83.9%); however, results were divergent regarding whether the altered state was hyperdopaminergic (9/26, 34.6%) or hypodopaminergic (17/26, 65.4%). The mixed findings may be partially explained by the variability in sample characteristics, study design, diagnosis criteria, and neuroimaging/genetic/pharmacological techniques used. However, it is possible that instead of being mutually exclusive, the hyperdopaminergic and hypodopaminergic state may co-exist, but in different stages of binge eating or in different individual genotypes.

Conclusions
For future studies to clarify the inconsistent findings, a homogenous sample that controls for confounders that may influence dopamine levels (e.g., psychiatric diseases) is preferable. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate whether the hyper- and hypo-dopaminergic states co-exist in different stages of binge eating or co-exist in individual phenotypes.

Plain Language Summary
Binge eating is characterized by eating a large amount of food in a short time and a feeling of difficulty to stop while eating. Binge eating is the defining symptom of binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa, both of which are associated with serious health consequences. Studies have identified several psychological risk factors of binge eating, including a strong desire for food, impaired cognitive skills, and distinct personality traits (e.g., quick action without careful thinking). However, the physiological markers of binge eating remain unclear. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is heavily involved in feeding behavior, human motivation, cognitive ability, and personality. Therefore, dopamine is believed to play a critical role in binge eating. This review synthesized study findings related to the levels and activities of dopamine, dopamine regulators, and dopamine receptors in the context of binge eating. The primary finding is that most studies that used neuroimaging, genetic, or drug techniques found an altered dopaminergic state related to binge eating. However, the literature is inconsistent concerning the direction of the alteration. Considering the mixed findings and the limitations in study design, future studies, especially those that include repeated measurements, are needed to clarify the role of dopamine in binge eating.

Neurotransmitters are biochemical molecules that transmit a signal from a neuron across the synapse to a target cell, thus being essential to the function of the central and peripheral nervous system. Dopamine is one of the most important catecholamine neurotransmitters since it is involved in many functions of the human central nervous system, including motor control, reward, or reinforcement. It is of utmost importance to quantify the amount of dopamine since abnormal levels can cause a variety of medical and behavioral problems. For instance, Parkinson’s disease is partially caused by the death of dopamine-secreting neurons. To date, various methods have been developed to measure dopamine levels, and electrochemical biosensing seems to be the most viable due to its robustness, selectivity, sensitivity, and the possibility to achieve real-time measurements. Even if the electrochemical detection is not facile due to the presence of electroactive interfering species with similar redox potentials in real biological samples, numerous strategies have been employed to resolve this issue. The objective of this paper is to review the materials (metals and metal oxides, carbon materials, polymers) that are frequently used for the electrochemical biosensing of dopamine and point out their respective advantages and drawbacks. Different types of dopamine biosensors, including (micro)electrodes, biosensing platforms, or field-effect transistors, are also described.

Hedonic hunger, the appetitive drive to eat to obtain pleasure in the absence of an energy deficit, is associated with overeating and with loss of control over eating, but has not been investigated among individuals with eating disorders.
(1) to compare participants with anorexia nervosa, restricting type (AN-R), anorexia nervosa, binge-purge type (AN-B/P), and bulimia nervosa (BN) on scores on the Power of Food Scale (PFS), a self-report measure of hedonic hunger; (2) to examine the relation between PFS scores and frequency of binge eating; and (3) to examine whether pre-treatment PFS scores predict weight change during treatment.
The PFS and measures of eating disorder symptomatology were administered to female patients with AN (N = 119) and BN (N = 144) at admission to residential treatment.
Participants with BN scored higher on the PFS compared to participants with AN-R or AN-B/P; there was a trend for those with AN-B/P to score higher than those with AN-R. PFS scores were positively associated with binge eating frequency among participants with BN; these associations remained significant when controlling for restraint and weight suppression. A similar pattern was found among participants with AN. PFS scores predicted weight change in AN but not BN.
Results suggest that hedonic processes may be important in stimulating binge eating. Furthermore, hedonic appetite may facilitate weight restoration in AN. Further research should investigate whether pre-treatment PFS scores have prognostic significance with respect to eating disorder symptoms. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (Int J Eat Disord 2013).

Dopamine projections from the midbrain to the striatum and frontal cortex are involved in behavioral reactions controlled by rewards, as inferred from deficits in parkinsonism, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Recent experiments have shown that dopamine neurons are not directly modulated in relation to movements. Rather, they appear to code the rewarding aspects of environmental stimuli. They show short, phasic increases of activity following primary food and liquid rewards (“unconditioned stimuli”) and conditioned, reward-predicting stimuli of visual, auditory, and somatosensory modalities. They also display smaller activation-depression sequences after stimuli resembling rewards and after novel or particularly intense stimuli. Rewards are only reported as far as they occur differently than predicted. According to learning theories, a “prediction error” message may constitute a powerful teaching signal for behavior and learning. The phasic reward message is different from the more tonic enabling function of dopamine that is deficient in Parkinson’s disease, indicating that dopamine neurons subserve different functions at different time scales. Neurons in other brain structures, such as the striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala, code the quality, quantity, and preference of rewards. The dopamine reward prediction error signal may cooperate with these reward perception signals during the learning and performance of behavioral reactions to motivating environmental stimuli.

The diverse physiological actions of dopamine are mediated by at least five distinct G protein-coupled receptor subtypes. Two D1-like receptor subtypes (D1 and D5) couple to the G protein Gs and activate adenylyl cyclase. The other receptor subtypes belong to the D2-like subfamily (D2, D3, and D4) and are prototypic of G protein-coupled receptors that inhibit adenylyl cyclase and activate K+ channels. The genes for the D1 and D5 receptors are intronless, but pseudogenes of the D5 exist. The D2 and D3 receptors vary in certain tissues and species as a result of alternative splicing, and the human D4 receptor gene exhibits extensive polymorphic variation. In the central nervous system, dopamine receptors are widely expressed because they are involved in the control of locomotion, cognition, emotion, and affect as well as neuroendocrine secretion. In the periphery, dopamine receptors are present more prominently in kidney, vasculature, and pituitary, where they affect mainly sodium homeostasis, vascular tone, and hormone secretion. Numerous genetic linkage analysis studies have failed so far to reveal unequivocal evidence for the involvement of one of these receptors in the etiology of various central nervous system disorders. However, targeted deletion of several of these dopamine receptor genes in mice should provide valuable information about their physiological functions.
