Scientific Research Highlights

[![learn more](https://www.annexpublishers.co/JSAP1/oamsecure/rh_images/289rh_image.jpg)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24391660)

#### [Identification and interrogation of combinatorial histone modifications](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24391660)

Histone proteins are dynamically modified to mediate a variety of cellular processes including gene transcription, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis. Regulation of these processes occurs through the recruitment of non-histone proteins to chromatin by specific combinations of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs).

#### [Closed loop adaptive optics for microscopy without a wavefront sensor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24392198)

A three-dimensional wide-field image of a small fluorescent bead contains more than enough information to accurately calculate the wavefront in the microscope objective back pupil plane using the phase retrieval technique.

#### [Quantitative single-cell RNA-seq with unique molecular identifiers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24363023)

Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful tool to reveal cellular heterogeneity, discover new cell types and characterize tumor microevolution. However, losses in cDNA synthesis and bias in cDNA amplification lead to severe quantitative errors.

#### [The Nonenzymatic Decomposition of Guanidines and Amidines](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24359273)

To establish the rates and mechanisms of decomposition of guanidine and amidine derivatives in aqueous solution and the rate enhancements produced by the corresponding enzymes, we examined their rates of reaction at elevated temperatures and used the Arrhenius equation to extrapolate the results to room temperature.

#### [Genomic mining of prokaryotic repressors for orthogonal logic gates](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24316737)

Genetic circuits perform computational operations based on interactions between freely diffusing molecules within a cell. When transcription factors are combined to build a circuit, unintended interactions can disrupt its function. Here, we apply \\'part mining\\' to build a library of 73 TetR-family repressors gleaned from prokaryotic genomes.

## How to use WorldCat.org

## Welcome to WorldCat.org

Get started with WorldCat.org. In about two minutes, you can learn how to make a WorldCat.org profile, create and add items to lists, export citations, and use facets to narrow your search criteria. It’s a quick way to introduce yourself to the basics of searching the world’s largest collection of information about materials in libraries.

[Learn more](https://search.worldcat.org/topics/welcome)

## Use WorldCat.org for school research

Learn additional basic and advanced search techniques in this simple tutorial. We’ll walk through how to get resources for a solar system report that a student might be assigned and also provide tips for college students and more advanced researchers.

## Genealogy

If you’re interested in genealogy or family history, you’re in the right place. Libraries and archives are often the only source for unique, local information about cemetery, burial, and military records; family Bibles, church, and town histories; indexes of births, marriages, and deaths; photographs, newspapers, microfilm, and so much more.

[**The Enhancement Performance of Bio Solar Cells by using Gold Nanoparticles**](https://www.annexpublishers.com/articles/JBB/3104-The-Enhancement-Performance.pdf)

Photovoltaic solar cells have been a promising solution to the world's environmental
air pollution in recent decades. However, despite their usage, Earth pollution has
still been a concern. As a result, bio-solar cells have been researched among bio--
physical researchers since 2012 to provide an environmentally compatible
alternative.

[**Homology Modelled Structure of Glutaredoxin 2 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii**](https://www.annexpublishers.com/articles/JBB/3102-Homology-Modelled-Structure-of-Glutaredoxin.pdf)

Different types of Glutaredoxins (GRXs) that play a major role in cellular
anti-oxidative reactions have been studied for
their structure and function from various organisms. Glutathione (GSH), an
anti-oxidant with several medical benefits,
binds to GRXs.

Biofilms are complex sessile microbial community extremely resistant to antibiotics.
They typically form on both biotic
and abiotic surfaces and are usually associated with high rates of mortality and
morbidity in patients in hospital settings.
Nosocomial infections are the major cause of infections seen worldwide.
