Abstract

Phytochemicals are chemicals produced by plants to serve as a defense against fungal, bacterial, and viral plant diseases. Currently,

our world has encountered a plethora of frustrating viral infections. For most people’s morbidity and corporality, viral infections

are primarily responsible. On the other hand, numerous plants’ secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenes, po-

lyphenols and their derivatives have effective potentials to decline the multiplication of different viruses and have the capability to

kill them. For instance, flavonoids can be used to treat novel corona virus, influenza A and others; phenols can be used to treat hu-

manpapillomavirus,herpesandthelikes.Understandingthesesecondarymetabolitesandtheirmechanismofactionsagainst

viruses is substantially insignificant. Therefore, the current review is ultimately intended to summarize some of the studied bioac-

tive phytochemicals with the practical potential of antiviral activity. The recent articles have been retraced some biologically active

materials were critically summarized with their potential efficacy of antiviral activities. Those chemicals are used for the treatment

of human diseases. Different studies in vitro and in vivo assays have depicted effective inhibition against several viral infections.

The results from different studies have brought user new hope to overcome the problem of drug resistance and unintentional side

effects on patients. Besides, it is understood that the bio functionalization of the active phytochemicals increases the efficiency of

the compounds to fight in advance against viral infection. It is also notable that the establishment of new strategies for drug deliv-

ery to the target site brings the intended goal. Overall, the present review has summarized that the employment of phytochemicals

as antiviral agents is more effective and economically feasible for patients when compared to synthetic chemicals.

stituents; and before 2010 GC, more than 8000 different phytochemicals are known \[1\]. When phytochemicals are used in con-

trolled amounts, it is globally accepted that they are innocuous and display different biological activities. Polyphenols are perti-

nent for antiviral research due to their wide structural diversity. The ability of phenolic groups such as radical meeting makes

them highly interesting to be harnessed as antiviral agents.

The study regarding existing viruses remains a hot research area due to their leading global consequences. To date, several infec-

tious viral diseases have been reported; and novel ones have emerged iteratively. These remain major global causes of morbidi-

ty and corporality. Some of the most aggressive viral infections include Ebola, Hepatitis, HIV/AIDS (Acquired Immune Defi-

ciencySyndrome),Herpes,Influenza,Poliomyelitis,SARS-COV(severeacuterespiratorysyndromecoronavirus)andthe

likes. According to indicated from different studies, these viral infections affect three to five million patients annually \[2\]. In-

fluenza is at the helm of over three million new cases of severe deaths and 300,000 to 500,000 deaths yearly \[3\].

Transmission methods such as blood transfusion, organ transplantations, and the use of hypodermic syringes are thoroughly in-

creasing the number of cases diagnosed with viral infections every year. Albeit classic antiviral drugs such as interferon and rib-

avirin are effective in vitro against most viruses, however, they are often ineffective in patients. Nowadays, there is no acqui-

esced in solution for various viruses; and vaccination is bounded to hepatitis A virus, mumps, and varicella \[3\].

Besides this, the agents are costly and ineffective due to the resistance capability of viruses and causes side effects. Considering

this, naturally based bio products can be an alternative to treating viral disease. Hence, it is required to further search the area

ofantiviralphytochemicalsandhighlightsystemofactiontoovercometheexistingbarriersfortheagentsandsuccessfully

reach into their deliberated sites of action.

Duringrecentyears,thepandemicofviraldiseaseshasinfluencedthescholarcommunitytodiscoverlessnocuousantiviral

plant compounds or phytochemicals instead of utilizing conventional agents such as protease inhibitors, nucleic acid analogs,

and other synthetic molecules as antiviral therapeutics. This approved that the development of clinical compounds from Phy-

to-pharmaceuticals is a tending approach to look for therapeutic molecules with no cytopathic problems. By having knowledge

about the molecular mechanisms of viral invasion and multiplication within the host cells, it will be possible to get help in de-

signing effective and inexpensive antiviral drugs and harnessing them to their specific site \[4\]. Plant phytochemicals such as al-

kaloids, flavonoids, phenols, tannin, anthocyanin, lignan, terpenoids, and the like are well-known natural products that are util-

ized as antiviral therapeutics. As the utilization of bioactive compounds against different viral ailments overcome the side ef-

fects and drug resistance of conventional antiviral drugs, it is curiously relevant to investigate the molecular mechanism of ac-

tion of eco-amiable biomaterials against the virus. However, in developing phytochemical based-antivirals, a number of cons-

traints are there that should have to be remediated. Challenges such as the limited understanding of bioavailability and pharma-

cokinetics, stability and shelf life, the mechanism of action and regulatory system, yield optimization of the targeted bioactive

compounds and the likes are the major constraints that are currently faced in developing plant bioactive compound based-an-

tiviral. These constraints can be remediated by figuring out the particular bioactive properties and their active sites against the

Literature Review

Plants and Their Antiviral Activity

Herbalmedicineisaneffectiveareaofresearchtopictosearchplantextractandestablishcurativepropertiesoftherapeutic

agents. Insignificant amounts of bioactive molecules were explored for their therapeutic uses. However, as it is implicated in dif-

ferent studies, medicinal herbs offer a broad range of therapeutic antiviral chemo types; and this can be manifested through in-

hibiting viral multiplication by viral adsorption, sticking to cell receptors, preventing viral entry in the host cell, and competing

for pathways of actuation of intracellular signals \[5\]. To get wellness and primary health care throughout the world, people pro-

ceed to depend on medicinal plants and their products. This is because herbal medicines have a high capability to cure diseases

and their fewer side effects when compared to the conventional synthetic molecules that are harnessed to therapeutic agents.

Currently, the research and development arena keeps customizing mechanisms relying on plant-based products for drug devel-

opment. Various secondary metabolite compounds are available in plants, including alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, terpenoids,

lignans, tannins, and others, which have a wide range of anti-infection and antioxidant activities. Most viral diseases are treated

relying on characteristics they imply after affection. Leading to this, several medicinal phytochemical extracts are under investi-

gation, and some have arrived for clinical attempting. Ti and his collogues conclude that herbal medicines proceed to provide

thefundamentalrawmaterialsforsomeofthemostcrucialanti-viraldrugsalthoughthereistheproceededdevelopmentof

new antiviral agents from synthetic sources. The other study also support this idea by elaborating those medicinal plants are at

the nucleus of medical sciences and are gradually passing from apothecary vials from the manufactured bags of the trad practi-

cians to the laboratories to make access unlimited new medicines synthesis model \[6\]. From this implication, it is possible to be

said that today’s most synthetic chemical drugs will be replaced by herbal medicines in near future.

The reason herbal medicine is selected over synthetic drugs is today’s challenge of drug resistance and the side effect of conven-

tionalmedicine.Mostofthewidelyknowndrugsapprovedforantiviralagentsderiveoriginfromnucleosides.Those

medicines derived from nucleosides are quickly undergoing adaptation conditions with the disease and these consequences to

drug resistance. The drug synthesized from a chemical substrate also possesses side effects. Different studies indicated that the

chemically synthesized drug have more side effects on the user and is less appropriate than herbal medicines. Because of the be-

liefs in herbal medicines, populations in developing countries harnessed medicinal plants for primary health care. Hence fore,

harnessing herbal medicines for antiviral agents has the potential to relieve the side effects observed due to the usage of chemi-

cally synthesized drugs.

Common Models for Antiviral Activity Assay

In vitro and in vivo models are an assay employed to evaluate the antiviral activity of natural products such as crude extracts, in-

gredients, and fractions. Different studies have elaborated that the antiviral models usually employed for these assays are molec-

ular and cellular-level models \[7\]. Molecular level models are the initial stage in screening a vast number of substances such as

extracts for their prevention and action systems on viral enzymes and function proteins. It is an in vitro model assay that can

harness different activities such as DNA Polymerase Activity Assay, Reverse Transcriptase Activity Assay, Hemagglutination In-

hibition Assay, and others. This provides curious activity information for different strategies including cellular-level models.

On the other hand, the cellular level model exploits the capability of viruses to infect and multiplicate cell lines in the cell cul-

ture system. The cell culture system is a rapid method to raise viruses at higher Titres to test the anti-viral activity assay of the

extracts. After the rapid analysis assay, the extract's potential to be used as an antiviral agent can be evaluated within animal

models such as mice, hamsters, ferrets, dogs, monkeys, and others. The authors also elaborated that complementary animal

models engender the favored viral infection with clinical symptoms like those observed in humans.

Most known Phytochemicals for Antiviral Activity

Nowadays, the pharmaceutical industries are indulging their focuses towards economically significant ventures of phytochemi-

cals. Components of phytochemicals in this phenomenon are urgently needed to be utilized as alternatives to treat various viral

infections including the novel Covid-19.

Flavonoids

Flavonoids are one of the widely studied phytochemicals and can be harnessed for different applications. Different components

of flavonoids have been studied for their potential to act as antiviral activities \[7-9\]. From different studies on this compound, a

prominent outcome has been investigated both inVitro and in Vivo assay against various viral infections. The compounds can

be used as treatment for viral infections such as the novel corona virus (Covid-19), influenza A virus and others. There are dif-

ferent classes of flavonoids and some of them are summarized in Table 1 with their anti-viral actions.

Catechins

Catechin is the other important compounds synthesized in tea plants. Different authors investigated the potential antiviral ef-

fectsofcatechinagainstmumpsviralinfection.Toinvestigatethepotentialefficacyofthecompoundagainstthevirus,the

mumps virus 13V165E2 strain has cultivated within African green monkey kidney Vero cell culture. Eight different catechins

with the catalytic residues of Mpro of the virus. These interactions prevent the virus from binding to the hosts’ receptor cell and

so that reduce the opportunity to be infected by the virus. Hence, the catechin and its precursors are relevant food derived drug

candidates to treat the Covid-19 and other viral infections \[13\].

Apigenin and Baicalin

As elucidated by different scholars, the bioactive molecules, apigenin and baicalin are naturally synthesized phytochemicals ob-

tained from different plants. These molecules can be recruited to treat different viral infections \[12\]. Rehman and his colleagues

explored the potential inhibition effect of apigenin and other bioactive molecules from Nymphaea alba extracts \[14\]. As depict-

ed from the results, apigenin has indicated significant inhibition effects on hepatitis C virus (HCV) using in vitro transfection

model assay. The inhibition mechanism of the compound is by inactivating the viral gene NS3 which is responsible for viral

protease expression.

The research studied by Banerjee and co-investigator explored the effect of baicalin against dengue virus through in silico study

\[15\]. The compound prevents the initial stage of viral infection through binding to the viral envelope protein. Besides, baicalin

compound extracted from Radix scutellaria is a prominent bioactive molecule to prevent influenza virus A infection. As illus-

trated from in vivo experiment, the authors concluded that the baicalin molecule inhibits the Viruses’ H1N1 and H3N2 by tar-

geting the miRNA of the virus so that prevent the viral infection.

Phenolic Compounds

As it has been concluded by different scholars, there are different classes of phenolic compounds that can be recruited for differ-

ent viral infection treatments \[2, 7\]. The following section depicts the sub classes of phenolic compounds meticulously.

Lignans

Lignans are vastly synthesized by different plants and exist in plant parts such as root, stem, bark, rhizome, leaf, flower, seed,

fruit, and others \[7\]. It is one of the natural bioactive molecules that can be harnessed for the treatment of different viral infec-

tions. As it has been suggested and summarized by Gnabre and his colleagues, this phytochemical can be used for different viral

ailments such as human immune deficiency Virus (HIV), human papilloma virus (HPV), herpes simplex and others \[16\]. Lig-

nans inhibit SP1 gene expression, so that the virus can no longer proceeds multiplication processes and cease to infect the tar-

get cells of the host. The recent review done by Cui and coworkers concluded that lignans have been classified in to two main

classes based on their chemical similarity i.e., classical lignans and neolignans \[17\]. Classical lignan, which was extracted from

Larrea tridentata and Phyllanthus niruri, is the major group of lignan which has been deeply explored and belongs to dibenzyl

butane subclasses \[7\]. The authors elaborated that these components of lignan can be recruited against different viral infections

such as HSV-1, HSV-2, HIV, HBV and HPV. The compounds prevent infection by avoiding the multiplication of virus within

the host’s cell.

On the other hand, the second subclasses of the lignan, neolignan have been clearly elucidated \[17\]. The major class of this phy-

tochemical and its subtypes have been extracted from plants such as Silybum marianum and Peperomia pellucida. As it has

been illustrated by different scholars and researchers, this bioactive molecule and its subtypes can be harnessed as antiviral

agents against different viral ailments such as HCV, IAV, HIV, HBV, CHIKV, DENV, Mayaro virus. The main molecular mech-

anism by which this bioactive compound acts against viral diseases is by inhibiting the multiplication of viral cells within the

host cells so that it reduces the infection and even cures the patients.

Tannin

Tannins are classes of phenolic compounds with high molecular weight and possess hydroxyl and carboxyl groups which per-

mit the natural complexes formation \[7\]. Tannin has been extracted from plants such as Phyllanthus amarus,Phyllanthus uri-

naria, Phyllanthus odontadenius, Phyllanthus niruroides, Phyllanthus discoideus, and Phyllanthus mullerianus of leaf, stem and

root; however, with different extents \[18\], Hamamelis virginiana of leaf and bark. As it is investigated by different scholars and

researchers, the bioactive tannin extracted from different plants can be utilized as antiviral agents against various viral ailments

such as IAV, HPV-16, DENV-2, HSP-1 and COVID-19. The molecular mechanism by which tannin acts against those viral in-

fection is through prevent the virus attachments to the host cells, suppressing the replication and multiplication of the virus

within the host cells and deactivating the expression of protein and enzyme expression which are so required for viral life pro-

ceeding.

Curcumin and Anthraquinone

Curcumin and anthraquinones are the basic classes of phenolic compounds that can be considered as vital for different biologi-

cal functions. Emodin, which is naturally occurring anthraquinone derivative has been extracted from Rheum tanguticum and

has been tested against HSV-1 and -2 infection and has investigated its antiviral activity on HSV infection both in vitro, in tis-

sue culture cells and in vivo, in a mouse model \[19\]. But it was elucidated from the results that the bioactive compound,

emodin can neither prevent nor acts as virucidal against HSV-1 and -2 at pretreatment assay; however, it acts as antiviral activi-

ty after the viral infection. The authors also have been demonstrated that the molecules show high potent of inhibition on

HSV-1 than HSV-2. The molecular mechanism by which the molecule acts on the virus is by inhibiting the biological function

of the virus so that it cannot proceed to infect the host cells.

On the other study, the potential capability of the reported anthraquinone and its derivatives as anti-COVID-19 infections has

been investigated by using silico molecular docking tools, namely autodock4 \[20\]. The authors have elucidated the target bind-

ing site of the bioactive molecules against the novel corona virus and these target sites include 3C-like protease, papain like pro-

tease and spike protein. Binding to this target site, the compounds inhibit the COVID-19 virus from attaching to the host recep-

tors cells. As it has been predicted from the study, the compounds may be recruited for the treatment of other different viral in-

fections such as adenovirus, CMV, hepatitis B and C virus, herpes, HIV, IAV, influenza, parainfluenza and others depending

others.Asithasbeenconcludedbytheseauthors,curcumincanpreventandevencureviraldiseasesbydifferentmolecular

mechanisms such as inhibition of viral genetic material multiplication, inactivation of gene expression, and as well as attach-

ment to the viral target site. This active biomaterial can be extracted and obtained from different plant types such as Curcumin

longa.

Alkaloids

Alkaloidsarenaturalphytochemicalsthatarewidelyknownfortheirbiologicalactivities.Theextractsofalkaloidcanbeob-

tained from different plant sources such as Peganum harmala, Aconitum carmichaelii, Pancratium trianthum, Annona muri-

cata and others \[22\]. This bioactive chemical has been studied widely for its broad spectrum of antiviral activities against differ-

ent DNA and RNA viruses. The authors concluded that it has shown effective antiviral activities against different viral ailments.

As indicated by different studies, this natural compound has shown a significant efficacy to act as antiviral agents against viral

ailments such as IAV, HCV, DEV \[22\].

On the other studies, it has been elucidated that alkaloid and its derivatives such as lycorine extracted from Lycoris radiate, Chi-

nese herbal medicine \[23\], Hom harringtonine extracted from plant species of the Cephalotaxus genus, Oxysophoridine extract-

ed from Chinese herbal medicines like Sophora alopecuroides and Siphocampylus verticillatus \[24\] can be recruited as an-

ti-SARS-CoV-2. As it has been concluded by the authors, the mechanisms used by some alkaloids derivatives to prevent corona

virus replication have not been clarified while lycorine modulates host factors to interfere with viral replication so that it ceases

the virus multiplication within host cells. However, the molecular action of those alkaloids’ derivatives against the corona virus

replication could be by inactivating the viral biosynthesis, blocking the viral gene expression, exerts virucidal activities, sup-

presses the expression of viral protein, modulates host factors and other mechanisms.

Saponin

Saponins are sugar conjugated natural chemicals with a wide range of biological functions including therapeutic characteristics,

antibacterial activity, antiviral activity, and so on. Figueiredo and co-authors have explored saponin from the extracts of root of

Solanum sisymbriifolium (Solanaceae) plant and seen the inhibition effects of the saponin against DENV. Investigators have

used saponin from the ethanol extracts of the plant root and found the high virucidal activity against DENV without a signifi-

cant cytotoxic effect on the Vero E6 cells. Albeit these authors did not elucidate the molecular action of this chemical against

the DENV, it has been illustrated in other studies that the bioactive material can acts inhibitory effects of the cyclic AMP phos-

phodiesterase \[25\].

Besides, the bioactive chemical, saponin, which has been extracted from Phaleria macrocarpa fruit has been assessed to see its

capability to act as antiviral agents to treat human herpes virus type-1(HHV-1). Investigators have been utilized the plaque re-

duction assay to analysis the efficacy of the compound to act as anti-HHV-1 post treatment, pre-treatment, virucidal, attach-

ment and penetration assay. From the study, it has been concluded that the extracts of the saponin from the selected plant dis-

turbs the early steps of the viral life cycle by the attachment and virucidal assays in dose-controlled activity.

Terpenoids

Terpenoids are various classes of naturally available bio compounds with different biological functions. Terpenoid is a deriva-

tiveofmevalonicacidconsistsofisopreneunit. These compounds are broadly spread in nature and extracted from different

plants and can be recruited as competent antiviral agents. The study held by Gyebi and his co-investigators declared that the

plant secondary material, terpenoid, can be harnessed as potential inhibitors of corona virus using in silico approaches. The ex-

plorers have docked different terpenoid derivatives from the plant’s native to Africa to the 3CLpro of the novel SARS-COV-2. It

has been implied from the ADMET study the drug likeness of the bio compounds and can be utilized as natural competent anti

SARS-COV-2 after extended study.

The review summarized by Mishra et al., \[26\] on the phytochemical and pharmacological properties of Hyptis suaveolens has re-

ported that the aqueous alcohol extract of H. suaveolens containing pentacyclic triterpenoids and ursolic acid indicates a signifi-

cant inhibition capability against viral infections such as CHIKV, HIV, SARS-COV-2; and the deepen exploration and analysis

enables to establish amiable and cost-effective competent drug against the mutating and resistant RNA viruses to care the

plethora of viral pathogens in future. On the other study, it has been predicted from the in-silico analysis of docking score and

binding energies with predicted pharmacokinetic profiles that the terpenoids phytochemical might possess a capability to act as

inhibitors against SARS-COV-2 Mpro. This prediction intrigues to extend the study into in vitro and in vivo investigation to un-

ravel and verify its inhibitory effects.

Carotenoids

Carotenoids are phytochemical compounds grouped under the class of tetraterpenoids, are derived from polyene chain with te-

tracarbonsthatserveasitsbackbone\[7\].Fromtheperspectivesofdifferentstudies,carotenoidscanbeclassifiedasxantho-

phyl, consists of oxygen, e.g., lutein, zeaxanthin and non-oxygenated form of carotenoids, e.g., carotenes \[27\]. These active bio-

materials have been explored; in vitro, and the extracted pigment of Haloarchaea, prohibited in advance ability to treat HCV

and HBV in infected human blood mononuclear cells than currently utilized drugs by suppressing the viral replication through

disturbing the normal function of polymerase in the virus \[28\]. On the other study, it has been reported that classes of

carotenoids such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and carotene can also act as antiviral action against HCV and HBV. As it has been illus-

trated on different study, the carotenoid also indicates significant potential inhibition against the pandemic COVID-19 by tar-

geting the inflammatory storm which is a consequence of the virus infection and could be utilized as a potential drug.

Supported by molecular docking approach, Fatima and co-investigators have reported the in vitro antiviral activity of lutein

against HCV. This paves a way to demonstrate a promising role of lutein to be act as antiviral drug against HCV. The possible

molecular action by which this bioactive can acts on the virus could be deactivating helicase which is curiously important for

the HCV replication. On the other hand, crocetin has the capability to treat against different viral infections like DENV by im-

proving the host response to the virus in vivo in mice \[29\] and HPV-16 and HPV-18 via sticking to the viral target site in mu-

cosal epithelial \[30\]. Thus, the deepen study about these compounds unravel and paves the way for the establishment of the ami-

able antiviral agents against the virus infection. The overall phytochemical antiviral activity is summarized in Table 2.

Summary

The potential efficacies of phytochemicals are varying in vitro and in vivo against different viral ailments. Most known phyto-

chemicals that are effective in anti-viral activity include alkaloids, phenols, flavonoids, curcumins, tannins, anthraquinones,

carotenoids, terpenoids, catechins, lignans, apigenin, and saponins. Each chemicals has their own properties and target viral

treatment. Most widely known viral treated by phytochemicals are HCV, Covid-19, mumps viral infection, HSV, HPV, IAV,

CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV, HIV, NoV, F-MuLV. These biomaterials can be recruited as alternative antivirals to conventional antivi-

ral drugs. Due to the drug resistance and unintended side effects of chemically synthesized antiviral medicines and vaccines, it

is curiously essential to explore the solution from natural sources which are cost-effective and amiable for patients. Various vi-

ral infections HIV, HSV, and HCV do not have a complete vaccine yet. The researchers came up with phytochemicals as a rem-

edy and harnessed those phytochemicals from different plants against virus disease in vitro and in vivo assay. This has brought

a new usher to fight the devastating viral ailments including the pandemic novel COVID-19.

In a nutshell, the review concluded that phytochemicals are biologically active chemicals with multifarious functions and poten-

tial efficacy to inhibit a plethora of viral infections; and should have to compensate for the utilization of chemically synthesized

antiviraldrugswhichhaveunintentionalsideeffectsonthepatients.Inavertingtheadaptedlandscapeofantiviraltherapies,

the exploration of secondary metabolites as sources of antiviral agents does have prominent roles. Therefore, it is a positive al-

Dengue fever is an infectious disease of the dengue virus. It becomes a severe problem, particularly prevalent in the tropics and the subtropical countries. The disease can make a life-threatening illness at any age of the people. Still, there is no definite treatment regimen for dengue infection. Nature is a vast reservoir of precious phytochemical substances that can be explored to develop new phytotherapeutics for dengue treatment. Using natural resources either directly as pharmaceuticals or as a structural base for chemical synthesis can optimize the development of new antiviral agents against dengue. In this paper, we have tried to determine the therapeutic potentialities of some natural products as the dengue antiviral agents through in silico study. We had studied the inhibitory pattern of five phytochemical components (baicalein, fisetin, fucoidan, hyperoside, β-carboline) against the dengue envelope protein of dengue virus serotype-2. Among the components, baicalein and β-carboline were the potential phytochemicals that can inhibit the early step of viral infection after binding with dengue envelope protein. Other phytochemicals did not show satisfactory results. This result will be helpful for the development of new medicines from natural resources.

Amaryllidaceae plants are rich in alkaloids with biological properties. Pancratium trianthum is an Amaryllidaceae species widely used in African folk medicine to treat several diseases such as central nervous system disorders, tumors, and microbial infections, and it is used to heal wounds. The current investigation explored the biological properties of alkaloid extracts from bulbs of P. trianthum collected in the Senegalese flora. Alkaloid extracts were analyzed and identified by chromatography and mass spectrometry. Alkaloid extracts from P. trianthum displayed pleiotropic biological properties. Cytotoxic activity of the extracts was determined on hepatocarcinoma Huh7 cells and on acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells, while agar diffusion and microdilution assays were used to evaluate antibacterial activity. Antiviral activity was measured by infection of extract-treated cells with dengue virus (DENVGFP) and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1GFP) reporter vectors. Cytotoxicity and viral inhibition were the most striking of P. trianthum’s extract activities. Importantly, non-cytotoxic concentrations were highly effective in completely preventing DENVGFP replication and in reducing pseudotyped HIV-1GFP infection levels. Our results show that P. trianthum is a rich source of molecules for the potential discovery of new treatments against various diseases. Herein, we provide scientific evidence to rationalize the traditional uses of P. trianthum for wound treatment as an anti-dermatosis and antiseptic agent.

Herbal active compound with immunoregulator ability is considered a potential therapy for COVID‑19 oral manifestation by downregulating pro‑inflammatory cytokine storm.
Meanwhile, anthocyanin and ternatin are the active compounds in Clitoria ternatea, which may act as a potential immunoregulator for COVID‑19 therapy. The intention of this investigation was to investigate anthocyanin and ternatin as active compounds in C. ternatea that may be able to increase anti‑inflammatory cytokine and inhibit pro‑inflammatory cytokine and key proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‑2 (SARS‑CoV‑2). This study implemented bioinformatic approach to
analyze anthocyanin and ternatin as active compounds in C. ternatea with anti‑ and
pro‑inflammatory cytokines and antiviral examination history through blind molecular
docking study (in silico). Moreover, anthocyanins and ternatin were obtained from
PubChem database by minimizing ligand structure in PyRx software to increase the
flexibility. RCSB database was employed for preparing the protein samples consisting
of interleukin (IL)‑6, SARS‑CoV‑2‑ACE2 glycoprotein complex, tumor necrosis factor‑α
receptor (TNF‑αR), matrix metalloproteinase‑9 (MMP‑9), IL‑6, IL‑10, and human beta
defensin‑2 (HBD‑2). In addition, The PyMol sofware was used to sterilize the protein
samples to obtain the molecular docking optimization. This investigation found that, in
the molecular docking simulation, the anthocyanin and ternatin showed producing the
negative binding affinity to the ACE2 domain which interacted with RBD glycoprotein SARS‑CoV‑2. Anthocyanin and ternatin were then predicted to be able to influence any inhibitory activity of TNF‑αR, MMP‑9, and IL‑6; increase IL‑10; and increase HBD2 binding affinity values negatively. It can be predicted through molecular docking that anthocyanin and ternatin as the active compounds in C. ternatea contribute as a potential agent for COVID‑19 oral manifestation therapy.

The lack of therapies for moderate COVID-19 syndrome prompted us to use a standardized polyphenolic green tea extract rich in catechins during the lockdown due to the pandemic in Italy (Autumn 2020). Catechins are powerful antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiviral agents that are safe for human use. While awaiting hospitalization, 10 swab-positive patients, symptomatic for SARS-COV-2, were treated for 15 days at home with two sessions of inhalation plus three capsules per day (total catechins: 840 mg; total EGCG: 595 mg). All patients recovered fully and had no symptoms at a median of 9 days, with a range of 7–15 days. Seven switched to a negative SARS-COV-2 nasopharyngeal swab test at a median of 9 days, with a range of 6–13 days. Among the 3 patients still swab-positive, one had a strong decrease of infection down to a “very low” SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid load at 5 days. All patients exited quarantine at the end of therapy because they were free of symptoms. Inflammation markers α-1 anti-trypsin, C-reactive protein and eosinophils had significantly decreased. The IL-6 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreased in 7 out of 10 patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the efficacy of green tea catechin against COVID-19 syndrome. These results may open new perspectives in the fight against the disease.

To date, the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide include viral infections, such as Ebola, influenza virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and recently COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Currently, we can count on a narrow range of antiviral drugs, especially older generation ones like ribavirin and interferon which are effective against viruses in vitro but can often be ineffective in patients. In addition to these, we have antiviral agents for the treatment of herpes virus, influenza virus, HIV and hepatitis virus. Recently, drugs used in the past especially against ebolavirus, such as remdesivir and favipiravir, have been considered for the treatment of COVID-19 disease. However, even if these drugs represent important tools against viral diseases, they are certainly not sufficient to defend us from the multitude of viruses present in the environment. This represents a huge problem, especially considering the unprecedented global threat due to the advancement of COVID-19, which represents a potential risk to the health and life of millions of people. The demand, therefore, for new and effective antiviral drugs is very high. This review focuses on three fundamental points: (1) presents the main threats to human health, reviewing the most widespread viral diseases in the world, thus describing the scenario caused by the disease in question each time and evaluating the specific therapeutic remedies currently available. (2) It comprehensively describes main phytochemical classes, in particular from plant foods, with proven antiviral activities, the viruses potentially treated with the described phytochemicals. (3) Consideration of the various applications of drug delivery systems in order to improve the bioavailability of these compounds or extracts. A PRISMA flow diagram was used for the inclusion of the works. Taking into consideration the recent dramatic events caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the cry of alarm that denounces critical need for new antiviral drugs is extremely strong. For these reasons, a continuous systematic exploration of plant foods and their phytochemicals is necessary for the development of new antiviral agents capable of saving lives and improving their well-being.

Background
Plants are the repository of variable number of valuable secondary metabolites that bears pharmacognostic and pharmacological implications having potentiality to emerge as super drugs in future. In-vivo production of these metabolites is influenced by the biotic and abiotic stresses resulting in continuous accumulation of diverse phytochemicals and their derivatives that can be useful in designing and developing potential drugs for future. The aim of the present study is to review the existence of medicinally important secondary metabolites and possible pharmacological and pharmacognostic importance of under-explored weed plant species Hyptis suaveolens (L.) Poit., to explore the potentiality of the plant for developing and designing the drugs for future.

Main body of the abstract
Hyptis suaveolens belonging to family Lamiaceae is the rich source of medicinally important phytochemicals like essential oils, tannins, saponins, phenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, and sterols. One or many of these compounds have antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, anti-septic, anti-cancer, anti-ulcer, antimicrobial, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, anti-diabetic, anti-fertility, diaphoretics, anticutaneous, anticatarrhal, antirheumatic, anti-ulcer, gastroprotective, immunomodulatory, analgesic, and antiviral activity.

Short conclusion
Hyptis suaveolens contains unique terpenoid metabolites like suaveolic acid, suaveolol, methyl suaveolate, beta-sitosterol, ursolic acid, and phenolic compound like rosamarinic acid, methyl rosamarinate that have potentiality to substitute the traditional drugs as therapeutic agent against the resistant and newly emerged bacterial and viral pathogens. Pentacyclic triterpenoid, ursolic acid have been reported to have effective antiviral response against the SARS-CoV2 responsible for the present COVID-19 pandemic and HIV virus for which no effective vaccines are available till date. Ursolic acid has the ability to modulate the activity of main protease (M pro ) that is essential for processing of SARS-CoV2 replicase-transcriptase machinery needed for viral replication and particle assembly.

The pandemic of viral diseases like novel coronavirus (2019‐nCoV) prompted the scientific world to examine antiviral bioactive compounds rather than nucleic acid analogous, protease inhibitors, or other toxic synthetic molecules. The emerging viral infections significantly associated with 2019‐nCoV have challenged humanity's survival. Further, there is a constant emergence of new resistant viral strains that demand novel antiviral agents with fewer side effects and cell toxicity. Despite significant progress made in immunization and regenerative medicine, numerous viruses still lack prophylactic vaccines and specific antiviral treatments that are so often influenced by the generation of viral escape mutants. Of importance, medicinal herbs offer a wide variety of therapeutic antiviral chemotypes that can inhibit viral replication by preventing viral adsorption, adhering to cell receptors, inhibiting virus penetration in the host cell, and competing for pathways of activation of intracellular signals. The present review will comprehensively summarize the promising antiviral activities of medicinal plants and their bioactive molecules. Furthermore, it will elucidate their mechanism of action and possible implications in the treatment/prevention of viral diseases even when their mechanism of action is not fully understood, which could serve as the base for the future development of novel or complementary antiviral treatments.

Anthraquinone derivatives are identified for their immune-boosting, anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral efficacy. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the reported anthraquinone derivatives as immune booster molecules in COVID-19 infection and evaluate their binding affinity with three reported targets of novel coronavirus i.e. 3C-like protease, papain-like protease, and spike protein. The reported anthraquinone derivatives were retrieved from an open-source database and filtered based on a positive druglikeness score. Compounds with positive druglikeness scores were predicted for their targets using DIGEP-Pred and the interaction among modulated proteins was evaluated using STRING. Further, the associated pathways were recorded concerning the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database. Finally, the docking was performed using autodock4 to identify the binding efficacy of anthraquinone derivatives with 3C-like protease, papain-like protease, and spike protein. After docking the pose of ligand scoring minimum binding energy was chosen to visualize the ligand–protein interaction. Among 101 bioactives, 36 scored positive druglikeness score and regulated multiple pathways concerned with immune modulation and (non-) infectious diseases. Similarly, docking study revealed torososide B to possess the highest binding affinity with papain-like protease and 3C-like protease and 1,3,6-trihydroxy-2-methyl-9,10-anthraquinone-3- O -(6′- O -acetyl)- β - d -xylopyranosyl-(1 → 2)- β - d -glucopyranoside with spike protein.
